--------------------------------------------------------------------
ESPRESSO can take advantage of several optimized numerical libraries
(essl, fftw, mkl...).  This configure script attempts to find them,
but may fail if they have been installed in non-standard locations.
If a required library is not found, the local copy will be compiled.

The following libraries have been found:
  BLAS_LIBS= -lblas 
  LAPACK_LIBS=-L/home/matic/libs/lapac/lapack-3.7.0 -llapack  -lblas 
  @delete@
  @delete@
  FFT_LIBS= -lfftw3 
  @delete@
  
  @delete@
  

Please check if this is what you expect.

If any libraries are missing, you may specify a list of directories
to search and retry, as follows:
  ./configure LIBDIRS="list of directories, separated by spaces"

Parallel environment detected successfully.\
Configured for compilation of parallel executables.
